# re-declaring a variable works

# to access a member of a sequence type, use []

# use slices to get parts of a sequence

# you can use slices to reverse a sequence

# dictionaries are accessed via keys

# ERROR: variables of different types cannot be combined

# Global vs. local variables in functions
